    # Basic configuration
    ForwardAgent yes                            # SSH key forwarding through connections
    StrictHostKeyChecking no                    # ⚠️ Masks host key change warnings (security risk)
    HashKnownHosts yes                          # Hash hostnames in known_hosts
    PermitLocalCommand yes                      # Allow local commands after SSH connection
    
    # Connection management
    ServerAliveInterval 30                      # Keep-alive signal every 30 seconds
    ServerAliveCountMax 3                       # Disconnect after 3 failed signals
    
    # Performance
    Compression yes                             # Compress data for slow connections
    ControlMaster auto                          # Reuse existing connections
    ControlPath ~/.ssh/control-%h-%p-%r         # Control socket path
    ControlPersist 10m                          # Keep connection open 10 minutes
    
    # Security
    Protocol 2                                  # Force SSH v2 (more secure)
    Ciphers aes128-ctr,aes192-ctr,aes256-ctr    # Encryption algorithms
    MACs hmac-sha2-256,hmac-sha2-512            # Message integrity algorithms
    
    # Network
    TCPKeepAlive yes                            # Keep TCP connection active
    GSSAPIAuthentication no                     # Disable Kerberos auth (faster)
